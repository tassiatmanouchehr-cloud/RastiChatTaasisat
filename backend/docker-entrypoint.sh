# Single entrypoint for the production backend image — the subcommand
# selects what this specific container instance does, so the SAME image
# built once by CI serves as the web process, the migration job, the
# automation-job worker, and the SLA-evaluator worker (deploy/rollback only
# ever has one image tag to reason about, never four).
#
# Deliberately does NOT run migrations automatically from the `web`
# subcommand: with multiple `web` replicas (or a rolling deploy where old
# and new replicas briefly coexist), every replica running
# `migrate` on startup races every other replica's migration lock and can
# apply a schema change out from under a still-running old-code replica.
# Migrations are their own explicit deploy step (see scripts/staging/deploy.sh)
# run exactly once, before any new `web` replica starts.
