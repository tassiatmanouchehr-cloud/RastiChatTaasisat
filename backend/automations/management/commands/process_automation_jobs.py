"""Idempotent, concurrency-safe processor for delayed automation actions
(ScheduledAction rows created by the SCHEDULE_ACTION action — spec section 6).

Run on a schedule (cron, or later a Celery beat task — deliberately
framework-agnostic so it drops into either) via:

    python manage.py process_automation_jobs

Each due job is claimed with SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED (Postgres)
inside its own short transaction and immediately flipped to RUNNING before
the lock is released, so two overlapping worker processes can never claim —
and therefore never execute — the same job twice. The actual action runs
outside that transaction (so a slow domain-service call never holds a
row lock); RUNNING already keeps every other worker out in the meantime.
A job that fails is returned to PENDING for a future retry until
`max_attempts` is reached, at which point it is permanently FAILED.

Stale-lock recovery: a worker that claims a job (marks it RUNNING) and then
crashes — killed process, host reboot, OOM — before reaching _finish()/_fail()
leaves that row permanently RUNNING with nothing to ever reclaim it, unless
something explicitly looks for RUNNING rows whose lock has clearly outlived
any real worker. That is what --stale-after-seconds/--recover-stale do below:
run automatically, every invocation, before the normal due-job pass, using
the exact same SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED claim pattern (so two
recovery sweeps racing each other can't both reclaim the same stale row) and
never re-incrementing `attempts` a second time for a lock it didn't itself
originally claim (attempts already went up once, at the original claim).
